Calculates an approximation of the movement of three charged particles due to Coulomb's Law during some time interval,
limited to the x-y plane due to limitations in graphing library. Z coordinates can be activated if lines _, _, _ are
commented out and lines _, _, _ are uncommented. This functionality simply prints out three-dimensional coordinates
without plotting. The user enters the particles' initial positions, velocity in the X and Y (and Z if in three-dimensional
mode) directions, mass, and charge on line _ or _ depending on mode, saves, then runs "python particles.py".
